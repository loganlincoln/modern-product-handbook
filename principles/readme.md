# Product Principles & Philosophy

These principles are high-leverage mental models that shape how product teams operate, make decisions, and measure success—especially when uncertainty is high and trade-offs are real.

## Principles overview

| Principle | Description | Strategic focus |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 Build a product-centric business | Design the organisation to achieve outcomes, not just deliver projects and outputs. | Operating model |
| 1.2 Focus on outcomes, not outputs | Use enduring teams and continuous improvement loops to deliver sustained value. | Core mindset |
| 1.3 Empower the team, enable autonomy | Give teams problems to solve and autonomy to deliver. | Ownership culture |
| 1.4 Obsess over a customer’s hardest problem | Focus on problems where solving them creates step-change value. | North star |
| 1.5 Be right, a lot, by thinking in bets | Treat work as hypotheses; use evidence to improve decisions. | Learning engine |
| 1.6 Own the outcome, not just the output | Measure success by outcomes, not shipping. | Measure of success |
| 1.7 Build for the future, one brick at a time | Prefer compounding improvements; invest in foundations. | Pace of delivery |
| 1.8 Build intelligent products | Use AI/data where it improves outcomes meaningfully. | AI leverage |
| 1.9 AI-first, human-centered | Use human-in-the-loop design and user control. | Design philosophy |
| 1.10 Speed to learning over speed to shipping | Optimise for validated learning, not activity. | Experimental engine |
