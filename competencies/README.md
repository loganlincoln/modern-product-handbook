# Product Competency Model

A product competency model is a framework for understanding and developing the skills required to build successful products. It is not a checklist. It is a tool for:
- Self-assessment and intentional growth
- Clear development goals
- Better coaching conversations
- Consistent expectations across teams

This model covers the spectrum of modern product work—from strategy to execution—and is grouped into five domains.

## The five domains of product craft

| Domain | Focus |
|---|---|
| Product strategy | Linking day-to-day decisions to long-term value, commercial outcomes, and product direction. |
| Product discovery & insight | Uncovering the right problems through customer learning, research, and evidence. |
| Execution & delivery | Translating validated ideas into shipped outcomes with predictable delivery. |
| Influencing people | Driving outcomes through trust, communication, and alignment without formal authority. |
| AI fluency | Building AI-enabled products responsibly (probabilistic systems, evaluation, ethics, and risk). |

## How to use this model

- Identify strengths (where you consistently perform well).
- Choose 1–3 growth areas (high leverage).
- Use it to structure career and performance conversations.
- Use it as shared language for coaching and mentoring.

## Role & competency assessment (example approach)

A competency model is most useful when paired with a lightweight, consistent development cadence.

### Principles

- Continuous, not annual
- Outcome-driven
- Collaborative
- Transparent

### Six-month growth cycle

1. **Self-assessment**
   - Reflect on the last cycle.
   - Choose 1–3 high-leverage growth areas.

2. **Growth conversation**
   - Discuss goals, gaps, and support needed.
   - Suggested prompts:
     - What are you most proud of?
     - What are your biggest growth opportunities?
     - How can support be provided?

3. **Development plan**
   - Document:
     - Target competencies (1–3)
     - Actions to practise (projects, leadership moments, deliberate reps)
     - Evidence of progress (what will demonstrate growth)
